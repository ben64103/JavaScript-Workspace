JSON is purely a string with a specified data format -- it contains no properties,
no methods

JSON requires double quotes to be used around strings and property names. Single quotes are not valid other than surrounding the entire JSON string.

Even a single misplaced comma or colon can cause a JSON file to go wrong, and not work. You should be careful to validate any data you are attempting to use (although computer-generated JSON is less likely to include errors, as long as the generator program is working correctly). You can validate JSON using an application like JSONLint
